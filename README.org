#+TITLE: mdo-modified
#+AUTHOR: Cody Reichert

This a theme for [[https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page][org-page]], an Emacs and Org-mode static site generator.

It's pretty much exactly like the built-in [[https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page/tree/master/themes][mdo]] theme, but with some
different fonts and CSS changes. As an example, [[https://codyreichert.github.io][my blog]] uses
mdo-modified.

** Installation
   Adding new themes to org-page is pretty easy:

   1) Clone this repo to anywhere on your system:
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   git clone git@github.com:CodyReichert/mdo-modified=
   #+END_SRC

   2) Make your org-page configuration aware of the new theme, and
      tell it to use it:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (setq op/theme-root-directory "/path/to/mdo-modified")
     (setq op/theme 'mdo-modified)
   #+END_SRC
